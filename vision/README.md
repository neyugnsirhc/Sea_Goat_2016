SeaGoat Vision
==============


This repo contains all of the vision software.


Description of each folder:
---------------------------


1. camera_cal- contains images and code that can be used to find the distortion parameters for a camera. The images were taken
with my camera (Nexus 6) 


ToDo:
-----
..*new photos will have to be taken with the cameras that will be going on the sub so we can find the distortion parameters.

2. harness_tests- This folder contains the files for unit subsystems test right now it contains the files to test webcams
and the ground markers

3. image_data_set- The folder contains the image dataset that I am using to test the marker detection code. Right now it
only contains a lighting data set. More folders should be added as more data sets are created to test the vision algorithms

4. seagoat_vision- contains the official library that all of the vision algorithms should be encapsulated in.
